	<h2 class="title">The Oriental View of Anthropology.</h2>

	<p>In the following essay, <strong class="name">Dr. F. Hartmann</strong>, an enlightened author
	of the Theosophical and Occult school, presents the mystic or Oriental
	view of man, in an interesting manner, deducing therefrom a philosophy
	of the healing art. My readers will no doubt be interested
	in his exposition, and, as the ancient doctrine differs materially from
	the results of experimental investigation, I take the liberty of incorporating
	my comments in publishing the essay.</p>

	<h3>A RATIONAL SYSTEM OF MEDICINE.</h3>

	<p>All lovers of truth, progress, and freedom of thought must be
	grateful to Dr. J. R. Buchanan for his discovery of the science of
	<span class="small_all_caps">SARCOGNOMY</span>. His system brings us nearer to a recognition of the
	true nature of man, his origin and his destiny, and of the relations
	which he bears to the Divine Source from which he emanated in the
	beginning, and to which he will ultimately return; for the enlightened
	ones of all nations agree that the <em>real</em> man, who resides temporarily
	in the physical human body, who feels through the instrumentality
	of the heart, and thinks through the instrumentality of the
	brain of the external body, does not originate in the womb of the
	mother from which the physical body is born, but is of a spiritual
	origin, again and again re-incarnating itself in physical masks and
	forms of flesh and blood, living and dying, and being reborn, until,
	having attained that state of perfection, which renders the inner man
	capable to exist in a state of spiritual consciousness without being
	encumbered by a gross earthly organization, which chains him to
	animal life.</p>

	<p class="response">[It should here be remarked that the great majority of those who
	are considered enlightened, and to whom the world is indebted for
	the sciences which it now possesses, do not accept this theory of re-incarnation.
	As commonly stated, it is liable to many decisive objections,
	and these objections, which I have clearly stated in the Religio-Philosophical
	Journal, have not been, and I think will not be, removed
	by the teachers of re-incarnation.]</p>

	<p>It may perhaps not be premature to examine how far the doctrines
	of Dr. Buchanan correspond with the doctrines of occult science;
	that is to say, with that science which is based upon a perception and
	understanding of certain facts, which, to be perceived, require spiritual
	powers of perception, such as are not yet developed in the majority
	<a class="pagenum" id="page2" title="2"> </a>of mankind, but which are only in possession of those who have
	mentally risen above the sphere of external phenomena and accustomed
	themselves to look at spiritual things with the eye of the
	spirit. It is not my intention to enter at present into an elaborate
	review of the most prominent writers on occult subjects, and to
	quote passages from such authors to support the views expressed in
	the following pages, but rather to give a short statement of their
	doctrines in regard to the omnipotent power of Will and Life; both
	these powers being fundamentally identical; both being merely different
	modes of actions, or functions, of that universal, eternal, and
	divine Central Power of the universe, which is beyond the conception
	of mortals, and which the latter call <em>God</em>.</p>

	<p>The ancient religions, as well as reason and logic, tell us that
	there is, and can be, only one supreme God, or First Cause of the
	universe, and that from this one first and fundamental Cause or
	Power every secondary power and everything that exists has come
	into existence, or been evolved within it and through its eternal activity.
	The whole of the universe with everything contained therein,
	man included, is and can be nothing else but a manifestation of
	this internal fundamental power, or, as it has been expressed by the
	ancient philosophers, the universe is the product of the Divine Imagination
	(thought) of the First Great Cause, thrown into objectivity
	by its eternal Will.</p>

	<p>We see, therefore, the great unmanifested <em>One</em> manifesting itself in
	its own <em>Substance</em> (Space) by means of <em>two</em> powers, <em>Thought</em> (imagination)
	and <em>Will</em> (the <em>Word</em> or Life); both powers being fundamentally
	identical and merely two different modes of activity or functions
	of the <em>One</em> Eternal, internal Principle, called God. According
	to the <em>Bible</em>, God said, “Let there be light,” and through the power
	of this outspoken “<em>Word</em>,” the world came into existence. This allegory,
	expressed in modern language, means that by the <em>active</em> Will of
	the universal First Cause, the images existing in its eternal memory
	were thrown into objectivity and thus produced the germs from
	which the worlds with all things existing therein were evolved and
	grew into the shapes in which we see them now. The <em>Brahmins</em> say
	that when <em>Brahm</em> awoke from his slumber after the night of creation
	(the great Pralaya) was over, he <em>breathed out</em> of his own substance,
	and thus the evolution of worlds began. If he <em>in-breathes</em> again,
	the worlds will be re-absorbed in his substance, and the day of creation
	will be over.</p>

	<p class="response">[God being essentially and self-evidently inconceivable by man, all
	attempts of Brahmin, Christian, or any other theologians to explain
	his existence and his methods of creation can be recognized by the
	scientific mind only as hypotheses unsusceptible of verification, and,
	therefore, incapable of becoming a proper basis of Philosophy.]</p>

	<p>Thus we find, on examining the doctrines of all the greatest religions
	of the world, that they all teach the same truth, although they
	teach it in different words and in different allegories. They all teach
	that there exist two fundamental powers, originating from the absolute
	<em>One</em>, namely, <em>Thought</em> and <em>Will</em>; and it logically follows that if
	<a class="pagenum" id="page3" title="3"> </a>a man were a complete master over his thoughts and his will, he
	could become a creator within the realm to which his thought and
	imagination extend; he could, consequently, by the power of his
	will and thought, control all the functions of his organism, the so-called
	involuntary ones as well as those which are voluntary. He
	could—if he possessed a perfect knowledge of his own constitution—restore
	abnormal functions to their normal state, and restore diseased
	organs to health.</p>

	<p class="response">[The mode of expression used in this paragraph is rather misleading.
	One may have a complete mastery of his thoughts and will,
	while both thought and will are very feeble and ineffective. It
	requires great <span class="small_all_caps">POWER</span> in the will and thought to acquire such control
	over bodily functions, and any expression leading persons of
	feeble character to suppose they can attain such results would be
	delusive. Many persons of feeble character have been led by current
	speculations to aspire far beyond their ability.]</p>

	<p>Another fundamental doctrine of Occultism is that man is a Microcosm,
	in which is germinally (potentially) contained everything
	that exists in the Macrocosm of the universe. <span class="response">[An unproved hypothesis.]</span>
	As the will and thought of that universal and divine internal
	power, which is called God, penetrates and pervades the whole of
	the universe; likewise the will and thought of man, if he has once
	attained perfect mastery over himself, extends through all parts of
	his organization, pervades every organ, and may be made to act consciously
	wherever man chooses to employ it. But in the present
	state of man’s condition upon this earth, no one but the adepts have
	acquired this power. In them thought and will act as one. In the
	vast majority of human beings thought and will are not yet in entire
	harmony, and do not act as one. In the regenerated one (the adept)
	heart and head act in perfect unison. The adept thinks what he
	wills, and wills what he thinks. In unregenerated humanity will and
	thought are divided and occupy two different centres. In them the
	will has its seat in the <em>blood</em> (whose central organ is the heart),
	and their thought or imagination has its seat in the brain. In them
	heart and brain are often not only not in perfect harmony, but even
	opposed to each other. But the <em>will</em> and <em>life</em> being one, and identical,
	we see that the central seat of <em>life</em> is not, as has been maintained
	by Dr. Buchanan, the <em>brain</em>, but the primary source of all life
	is the <em>heart</em>.</p>

	<p>We see, therefore, a discrepancy between the doctrines of Dr. Buchanan
	and the occult doctrines in regard to Anthropology; but this
	discrepancy is of no serious consequence; because the <em>moon</em> (the
	<em>intellect</em>) is in our solar system as necessary as the <em>sun</em> (the <em>will</em>),
	and as the vast majority of people have a considerably developed intellect,
	but only a very little developed will, and live, so to say, more
	in their brains than in their hearts, they may be looked upon as
	receiving their powers and energies from their brains, while the brain
	receives its stimulus from the heart. The ancient Rosicrucians compared
	the heart to the <em>sun</em>, the intellect, or <em>brain</em>, to the moon. The
	moon receives her light from the sun, the centre of life of our solar
	<a class="pagenum" id="page4" title="4"> </a>system. If the sun were to cease to exist, the moon would soon
	lose her borrowed light; likewise if the sun of divine love ceases to
	shine in the human heart, the cold, calculating intellect may continue
	to glitter for a while, but it will finally cease to exist. If the brain
	vampyrizes the heart, that is to say, if it absorbs the greater part of
	the life principle, which ought to go to develop love and virtue in
	the heart, man may become a great reasoner, a scientist, arguer, and
	sophist; but he will not become <em>wise</em>, and his intellect will perish in
	this life or in the state after death. We often see very intellectual
	people becoming criminals, and even lunatics are often very cunning.
	That which a man may call his own in the end, are not the thoughts
	which he has stored in his perishable memory; but the fire of love
	and light which he has kindled in his heart. If this fire of life
	burns at his heart it will illuminate his mind, and enable the brain
	to see clear; it will develop his spiritual powers of perception, and
	cause him to perceive things which no amount of intellectual brain-labor
	can grasp. It will penetrate even the physical body, and
	cause the soul therein to assume shape and to become immortal.</p>

	<p>It is not to be supposed that the above truths will be at once
	accepted by every reader of the <cite class="name">Journal</cite>, except by such as have
	given deep thought to the true nature of man. Neither are they
	a subject for scientific controversy or disputation. A knowledge of
	the truth is not produced by disputations and quarrels, but only
	by direct perception, experience, and understanding. The conclusions
	which man arrives at by logic are merely productive of certain
	opinions, and these opinions are liable to be changed again as
	soon as the basis from which his logic started, changes. A real
	knowledge of spiritual truths requires a power of spiritual perception,
	which few men possess. Nevertheless, even our logical deductions,
	taking as a starting point that which we know to be true, will
	help us to arrive at the same conclusions at which the Hermetic
	philosophers arrived by the power of spiritual perception.</p>

	<p class="response">[In the foregoing passage, Dr. H. professes to state doctrines derived
	from intuition or spiritual perception by the ancients, and also
	recognized to-day by spiritual perception. To me they appear
	as the results only of that sort of ancient <span class="small_all_caps">SPECULATION</span>, which recognized
	earth, air, fire, and water as the four chemical elements of all
	things. I do not find them sustained by the spiritual perception of
	those who have the intuitive powers to-day, nor by scientific investigation.
	The substance of the heart is <em>not the seat of life</em>. It is a
	merely muscular substance, and ceases all action when separated
	from its controlling ganglia. The vitality of the heart lies in its
	ganglia—in other words, in the nervous system, <em>in which alone is
	life</em>, and of which the brain is the commanding centre. That life
	resides exclusively in the nervous system is one of the established
	principles of physiology, which cannot be disturbed by any theories
	descending from antiquity, before the dawn of positive science.
	That the will resides in the blood and the heart, is about as near
	the truth as Plato’s doctrine that the prophetic power belonged to
	the liver. If the region of Firmness in the brain be large, it will
	<a class="pagenum" id="page5" title="5"> </a>be strongly manifested, even though the heart be feeble, and as easily
	arrested as Col. Townsend’s. But if the upper surface of the brain be
	diseased, or sensibly softened, the will power is almost destroyed,
	even if the plethoric, hypertrophied heart is shaking the head with
	its power. Many an individual of a delicate frame, has overpowered
	by firmness and courage stout, muscular men of far larger hearts. That
	the brain is the organ of thought alone, is a very old crudity. It contains
	every human emotion and passion, which we may stimulate in
	the impressible, or suspend instantly by a slight pressure on the
	brain. There is no intense exercise of any of the emotions or passions
	without a corresponding warmth and tension in the portion of
	the brain to which they belong, the development and activity of
	which determine their power. The will and life are not <em>identical</em>, as
	Dr. H. suggests, for if they were, we should not have these two
	words with different meanings. If will is an attribute of life, that
	does not constitute <em>identity</em>. The speculations of Rosicrucians are
	of no authority in science. The divine love or influence is in direct
	relation to the brain, the central organ of the soul, and not to a muscular
	structure of the body, which is far below the brain in rank. It
	would be just as reasonable to affirm that courage belongs only to the
	muscles. That illuminating love which Dr. H. ascribes to the heart,
	belongs to the upper region of the brain, and is never found when
	that region lacks development, or is in a cold, torpid condition. I
	deny entirely that these mystic theories are the product of true, spiritual
	perception. They arise from the fact that the thoracic region
	sympathizes with the seat of true love and will in the brain. This
	secondary effect has been felt and realized by those to whom the
	functions of the brain were unknown. Spiritual perception, now
	guided by the spirit of investigation, discovers the whole truth—that
	all human faculties and impulses belong to the brain, but have a
	secondary influence on the localities of the body to which <span class="small_all_caps">SARCOGNOMY</span>
	shows their relations.]</p>

	<p>If we believe in one great spiritual cause of all, and conceive of it
	as the great spiritual Sun of the universe (of which our terrestrial
	sun is merely an image or reflection), we find that spiritual man (the
	image of God) can be nothing else but an individual ray of that
	spiritual sun, shining into matter, becoming polarized and forming
	a centre of life in the developing human fœtus, and causing this
	fœtus to grow in a living form of human shape, according to the
	conditions presented to it by the maternal organism, and when it is
	born, and becomes conscious, the illusion of self is created within
	that individual form. Besides the gross, visible, external form, more
	ethereal internal forms are evolved, which are of a longer duration
	than the outward physical form, but of which it is not necessary to
	speak at present.</p>

	<p>At all events, all that we positively know of man, is that he is an
	invisible internal power, which evolves an outward shape, which we
	call a human being. The material through which the organism is
	built up is the blood, and the centre from which the blood flows into
	all parts of the body and to which it returns from all parts, is the heart.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page6" title="6"> </a>The heart is consequently the centre from which that power which
	builds up the organism of man emanates, and as this power can be
	nothing else but Life, the heart is the centre of life. The heart and
	the brain stand in the most intimate relation to each other, and
	neither one can continue to live if the other one ceases to act; but
	according to the doctrines of the ancient and modern occultists the
	heart is of superior importance than the brain. A man may live a
	long time without thinking, but he ceases to live when his heart
	ceases to beat. The heart is the seat of life, the brain the seat of
	thought, but both are equally necessary to enjoy life; there is no
	intellectual activity without life, and a life without intelligence is
	worthless. That the force which constructs the organism of man
	emanates from the heart, appears to me to be self-evident; that the
	power which guides this construction emanates from the brain has
	been demonstrated by Dr. Buchanan.</p>

	<p class="response">[This is quite incorrect. The heart may cease acting, as in apparent
	death while the processes of thought and feeling are going on,
	and the individual is conscious that he is going to be buried, but
	incapable of giving the alarm. On the other hand the action of the
	brain may be suspended, as in apoplexy, while the heart is beating
	vigorously. In such cases, though the action of the cerebrum is suspended,
	the physiological brain or cerebellum sustains physical life.
	We cannot say that the heart is superior to the brain, because it
	supplies the brain with blood for its growth, any more than we could
	say the same of the lungs, which supply oxygen, without which the
	action of the brain is speedily arrested. We might even extend the
	remark to the stomach and thoracic duct, which supply the material
	for making a brain, which certainly does not prove their superiority.
	The action of the brain is far more important, for the quickest death
	is produced by crushing the brain, or by cutting it off from the body
	in the spinal cord of the neck, when heart, lungs, and stomach are
	promptly arrested by losing the help of the brain. If prior development
	in growth proved a superiority of rank, the ganglionic system
	which accompanies the arteries and precedes the evolution of the
	convoluted cerebrum would hold the highest rank, although it is
	destitute of consciousness and volition, which belong to the brain
	alone.]</p>

	<p>But what is this power which emanates from the brain, and which
	guides the organizing activity of the soul, but the power of life
	which is transmitted to the brain from the heart, and which is modified
	in its activity by the peculiar organization of the latter? Man
	in his present state does not think with his heart, but with his brain;
	nevertheless, the heart is superior to the brain, for the brain has
	been built up by the power which came from the heart; and it is a
	universal law of nature, that no thing can produce anything superior
	to itself. During its fœtal existence the brain of the child is
	built up by the blood of the mother; after man is born his brain
	receives its power of life through the heart, and in spiritually developed
	man the thought-force created in the brain reacts again upon the
	will in the heart, controlling its desires and entering into harmonious
	<a class="pagenum" id="page7" title="7"> </a>union with the latter. The ancient alchemists say: “If the Sun
	(the heart) enters in conjunction with the <em>Moon</em> (the brain) then
	will Gold (Wisdom) be produced.”</p>

	<p>We see, therefore, in man two centres of life, the heart and the
	brain, and it may properly be said that the brain is the seat of
	life, only it may perhaps be added, that it is the secondary seat,
	while the principal seat is, or ought to be, in the heart. <span class="response">[Dr. H.
	identifies will with life, yet every one knows that all acts of volition
	proceed from the brain alone, and never from the heart; hence by his
	own statement the brain is the seat of life.]</span> According to the doctrines
	of the Hermetic philosophers, God is the invisible central fire
	in the universe from which the Light of the Logos (Christ or the
	celestial Adam) emanated in the beginning. Man being a Microcosm,
	contains in his heart the image of that internal and invisible
	central fire of <em>Love</em>, which sends the light of thought to the brain
	and illuminates the mind of the seer. We are at present not living
	in the age of Love, but in the age of Thought (not the age of <em>Reason</em>,
	but the age of <em>Reasoning</em> and Speculation), and by the law of
	heredity, life has become pre-eminently concentrated in the brain;
	while in a more advanced age, when the principle of universal Love
	and Benevolence will be generally recognized, life will become more
	strongly concentrated at the heart. Men will then not only think, but
	feel and become able to recognize the truth by that power which is
	known to us in its rudimental state as <em>Intuition</em>, but which, if
	developed, will be far superior to that uncertain feeling called Intuition,
	and become a Sun within the heart, sending its rays far up into
	the regions of thought. Then, as their Love for the supreme Good
	increases, will their knowledge increase, and as their knowledge
	expands will their Will become powerful and free.</p>

	<p class="response">[The physiology of this passage is all erroneous. In the ages of
	animalism and barbarism the heart is more powerful, like the rest of
	the muscular system to which it belongs. In a more humane and
	refined condition the brain is more predominant. The female heart
	is not as well developed as the male. The moral superiority of
	women is due not to the heart but to the superior region of the
	brain, to which we owe all elevation of individuals and society.]</p>

	<p>It has been said above that Will and Life are identical, and there
	are sufficient facts to prove that they are one. A man may prolong
	his life by an effort of will, or he may cease to live if he wills to die.
	A loss of will-power in a limb is identical with paralysis of the latter.
	If the will (conscious or unconscious will) ceases to act, man
	ceases to live. No amount of thought exercised by the brain will
	raise a limb of a person, unless the person has the will to raise it;
	no amount of imagination on the part of the brain will execute an act,
	unless the will guided by the imagination causes the act to be
	executed. In the blood,—the representative of the animal life-principle
	(Kama-rupa) is the seat of the will, its central office is the
	heart. There the will or life-power acts consciously or unconsciously,
	sending its rays to the brain, where they become more refined, and
	from thence they radiate again back through the organism, causing
	<a class="pagenum" id="page8" title="8"> </a>the unconscious or conscious processes of imagination and thought.
	The way in which these processes take place, has been well described
	in Dr. Buchanan’s “Therapeutic Sarcognomy.” Love, Will,
	and Life are ultimately one and the same power; they are like the
	three sides of a pyramid ending in one point, or like a star emitting
	a light of three different hues. Without the fire of divine Love at
	the centre there will be no good and powerful Will, without Will
	man is a useless being, without virtue and without real life, an
	empty shell or form kept alive by the play of the elements, ceasing
	to exist when the form falls to pieces. But he who possesses a
	strong love for the good, the beautiful, and true, grows strong in
	Will and strong in Life. His heart sends a pure current of life to
	the brain, which enables the latter to see and grasp the ideas existing
	in the Astral light. The purer the will the more pure will be
	the imagination, and the more will the latter be able to rise to the
	highest regions of thought, while these exalted thoughts will radiate
	their light back again to the heart and stimulate the heart as the
	heart stimulated the brain.</p>

	<p>A consideration of the above will go to prove that Love (Will or
	Life) and Thought (Imagination or Light) are the forces by which
	the soul forms and regenerates the external body, and that he who
	obtains mastery over these forces within his own organism will be
	able to change and remodel his body and to cure it of all ills. The
	fountain of life is the will, and if the will is good and pure and not
	poisoned by the imagination, a pure blood and a strong and healthy
	body will be the result. If the imagination (thought) is pure, it
	will purify the will and expel from the latter the elements of evil.
	<em>The fundamental doctrine of the most rational system of medicine
	is therefore the purification of the Will and the Imagination</em>, and
	every one carries within his own heart the <em>universal panacea</em>, which
	cures all ills, if he only knows how to employ it. The purification and
	strengthening of the will by acts of love and human kindness and
	by leading a pure and unselfish life, should be the principal object
	of all religious and scientific education. The Bible says: “If the
	<em>salt</em> (the will) of the earth is worthless, wherewith shall it be
	salted?” If the fountain from which all life springs is poisoned by
	evil thoughts, how can the soul and body be healthy? The best
	<em>blood-purifier</em> is a pure will, rendered pure by pure and holy
	thoughts.</p>

	<p>This fundamental and self-evident truth is continually overlooked
	in our present age. The education of the intellect for the purpose
	of attaining selfish interests is made of paramount interest and the
	heart is neglected and left to starve.<a href="#footnote_1" id="fnm1" title="There is no higher gift..." class="fnmarker">1</a> The life-energy which ought
	to be employed to educate the heart and to render the will good and
	pure, is wasted in the top story of the temple of man in idle speculations
	about external and worthless things, in scientific quarrels and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page9" title="9"> </a>dogmatic disputations, which have usually no other object but to
	tickle personal vanity and to give to ignorance an external coat of
	learning. Many of our modern scientific authorities resemble ants,
	which crawl over a leaf which fell from a tree: they know all about
	the veins and cells of that leaf, but they know nothing whatever of
	the living tree, which produces such leaves, and moreover flowers
	and fruits. Likewise the rational medicine based upon reason and
	understanding, the science springing from a true knowledge of man
	will forever remain an enigma to the legally-authorized guardians of
	the health of humanity, as long as they know nothing of man except
	his external form and refuse to open their eyes and to see the eternal
	internal power, of which the external form is merely an evanescent
	image, a transient manifestation.</p>

	<p>Hoping that with the appearance of the <cite class="name">Journal of Man</cite> a
	new era of truly rational medicine will begin in progressive America,</p>

	<p class="dateline">I am yours truly and fraternally,<br />
	<strong class="name">Franz Hartmann</strong>, M.D.</p>

	<p><strong class="name">Kempten, Bavaria</strong>, April 7, 1887.</p>

	<p class="response">[While reaching my conclusions in a different manner by careful
	and prolonged experimental investigation, and expressing them
	differently, I agree with Dr. Hartmann in his most important principle,—the
	importance of love as the best element of life, in sustaining
	health and intelligence, and the necessity of its culture in education,
	which has been so long neglected, and which I have endeavored to
	enforce in the “New Education.” The structure and functions of
	the brain demonstrate that its love region is the chief support of
	its life, that it supports both will and intelligence, and that it not
	only sustains the highest health of him in whom it is developed and
	exercised, but ministers also to the health of all whom he meets, and
	is the great healing power in those whose presence or touch relieves
	the sick. The existence of this beneficent power in the human
	constitution, more restorative and pleasant than all medicines when
	present in sufficient fulness, is rapidly becoming known throughout
	our country, and is made intelligible as to its origin, nature and
	application by Sarcognomy, as I am teaching in the College of
	Therapeutics. Medical colleges, in their ignorance and jealousy,
	unwisely exclude and war against this nobler and more ethical
	method of healing, thus compelling its development and practice as
	a distinct profession, which is rapidly undermining their influence
	and diminishing their patronage by showing that, in many cases
	where drug remedies have totally failed as applied by colleges, the
	psycho-dynamic faculty of man may accomplish wonders.]</p>

		<p><strong class="headline">Religion and Science</strong> are exceedingly harmonious in assisting
		each other, but theologians and scientists are exceedingly discordant.
		Who is in fault? It is the fault of both. Both are bigoted and
		narrow-minded. Neither can see the truths that belong to the other
		party; theologians dislike science, not being able to see that science
		is a grander and more unquestionable revelation than any they have
		derived from tradition, and scientists deride religion and theology,
		not being able in their narrowness to recognize the higher forms of
		science in the great spiritual truths which have been apparent to
		all races from the most ancient limits of history. Of the scientific
		class the majority are averse to the religion of the times, partly
		from their own sceptical nature, and partly because religion has
		been presented in the repulsive forms of an absurd theology.</p>

		<p>Prof. E. S. Morse, the president of the American Association, is a
		very sceptical agnostic.</p>

		<div class="poem">
			<div class="stanza">
				<p>Proud Huxley’s the Prince of Agnostics, you see,</p>
				<p>And Huxley and I do sweetly agree.</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<p>At the late meeting of the Association, August 10, at Columbia
		College, New York, Prof. Morse made an address in which he is reported
		as saying that “Dr. Darwin’s theory was accepted by
		science, although ecclesiastical bodies now and then rose up to
		protest against it. He asserted that the missing links for which
		there was such a clamor were being supplied with such rapidity that
		even the zoölogist had to work to keep up with his science. It was
		a singular fact that no sooner did some one raise an objection to the
		theories of derivative science, than some discovery was made which
		swept down the barrier. It was safe enough for an intelligent man,
		no matter what he knew of science, to accept as true what science
		put forth, and to set down as false whatever the church offered in
		opposition. Every theory and declaration of science had been opposed
		by the church. The penalty of original sin, according to a
		scientific writer, was the penalty of man being raised to an upright
		position.  Laughter.] Cannot it be proved without question that
		the illiteracy of Spain was the result of centuries of religious oppression
		and of the inquisition?”</p>

		<p>One of the scientists told a <cite>World</cite> reporter (says the <cite>Truth Seeker</cite>)
		that at last year’s convention in Buffalo, Prof. Morse made an address
		that was so full of infidelity that the Catholic diocesan authorities
		there forbade the clergy from attending the meetings.</p>

		<p>However, the Association has a small orthodox element in it, and
		on Sunday about one-eighth of the members held a prayer-meeting
		at Columbia College, at which allusions were made to the ungodly
		character of the majority of their associates, which the said associates
		on Monday regarded as a very objectionable proceeding.</p>

		<p>In the contests between scientists and theologians it has long been
		apparent that the theologians are steadily receding. The time was,
		two or three hundred years ago, when fearless scientists were imprisoned
		<a class="pagenum" id="page11" title="11"> </a>or burned by theologians. Now, the scientists who lead the
		age treat theology with contempt and the press sustains them.
		Meanwhile, scientific scepticism is invading the pulpit, and all that
		distinguishes the Bible from any treatise on moral philosophy is
		gradually being surrendered by leading theologians; they are losing
		religion as well as theology.</p>

	<div id="misc2" class="miscellany_item">
		<p><strong class="headline">Good Psychology.</strong>—Prof. Wm. James, of the chair of Philosophy
		in Harvard College, and apparently the most philosophic gentleman
		in that conservative institution, has published in the <em>Popular
		Science Monthly</em> an essay on <cite>Human Instincts</cite>, characterized by a
		vigorous common sense and close observation. When he asserts
		(contrary to the old metaphysics) the existence of such instincts as
		fear, acquisitiveness, constructiveness, play (or, properly, playfulness),
		curiosity, sociability, shyness, secretiveness, cleanliness, modesty,
		shame, love, coyness or personal isolation, jealousy, parental love,
		etc., he shows the spirit of science. But is it not self-evident, Mr.
		James, to a man of your fine intelligence, that all strong impulses
		(or instincts, as you call them) must have a special nervous apparatus
		in the psychic region of the brain; and that loving, blushing,
		stealing, and fighting cannot be functions of the same organs concerned
		in perceiving color, or comprehending music? If I have
		traced these instincts to the special convolutions in which they
		reside, and given innumerable demonstrations of their locality, even
		in Boston, and before critical observers, why have you not interested
		yourself in the question of the cerebral localities and the complete
		demonstration of all the instincts by that method?</p>

		<p>I have even found an instinct of the <em>love of truth</em> among the higher
		sentiments, which, to a few rare individuals, is the predominant
		impulse of their lives, though, alas, in college professors, as well as in
		other classes generally, it is “inhibited” by a great variety of opposing
		instincts, interests, and social influences. Nowhere is it more
		completely “inhibited” than in Boston and Cambridge, as I have
		been informed by the most intelligent old citizens.</p>

		<p><strong class="headline">The Far-away Battle.</strong>—In the quiet home the sounds of the
		far-away strife are not heard. The war of the cannon is determining
		the destiny of empires, but it is unheard in the cottage. The
		myriad sounds of commerce in the city do not disturb the quiet of
		that home. Its quiet life attracts no attention. But there is something
		in that home more important than war or commerce or king-craft—something
		that concerns human welfare more profoundly.
		In that quiet home, a human life is developing; a human soul
		preparing for its life work—a work that will change the destiny of
		coming generations. In many quiet homes such a work is in progress,
		determining a nation’s future.</p>

		<p>All important movements are quiet and obscure in their origin.
		As the magnificent forest was slowly and obscurely germinated in
		darkness, in the seeds from which it sprung, so are the great discoveries
		in science and philosophy matured in quietness and obscurity.
		The thinker hears afar the sound of strife and the agitation of parties
		<a class="pagenum" id="page12" title="12"> </a>warring for power. He knows the follies and errors that agitate
		mankind, but he is withheld from entering the strife, for he has a
		more important work to accomplish—a work for the future. It is
		to such work that the <cite class="name">Journal of Man</cite> is devoted; laying the
		foundation of that philosophy in which future thinkers shall find the
		principles of social reorganization. It does not join in the strife of
		contending parties, nor does it recognize any existing party as entirely

		<p><strong class="headline">How not to do it.</strong>—The Seybert commission having made a
		splendid failure to find interesting and valuable facts where other
		investigators have succeeded, their blundering ignorance is now assisted
		by newspaper mendacity. The <cite>New York Times</cite>, of Aug. 22,
		concludes an extremely stupid article on this subject, by the following
		paragraph, which, if the writer gave any indications of intelligence,
		would be set down as a pure specimen of mendacity, but is
		more probably a specimen of indolent ignorance:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>“If Spiritualists could furnish one clearly-proved case of a spirit

		<p>There must be an immense mass of the same kind of lazy ignorance

		<p><strong class="headline">Robbery of Public Lands.</strong>—The report of Surveyor General
		Geo. W. Julian, of Colorado, shows that of the patented and
		unpatented lands referred to, aggregating 8,694,965 acres, it will be
		safe to estimate that at least one-half have been illegally devoted to
		private uses under invalid grants, or unauthorized surveys.</p>

		<p>He thinks it would not be extravagance to say that these land
		claimants, with their enormous interests, have exercised a shaping
		influence upon Congress. Congress has approved 47 out of 49 of
		these claims. In this connection the report calls attention to the
		action of Congress in 1860, and the Interior Department in 1879 in
		the famous Maxwell land grant case, which he characterizes as a
		wanton and shameful surrender to the rapacity of monopolists of
		1,662,764 acres of the public domain, on which hundreds of poor
		men had settled in good faith and made valuable improvements. It
		has been as calamitous to New Mexico, says the Surveyor General,
		as it is humiliating to the United States. The report says:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>“During the last Congress several members of both Houses, including
			the delegate from this Territory, reported bills for the confirmation
			of the Socorro grant, which is one of the most shocking of the
			many attempts yet made to plunder the public domain. I do not
			say that the men who introduced these bills intended to make themselves
			<a class="pagenum" id="page13" title="13"> </a>parties to any scheme of robbery, but their action shows that
			the hidden hand of roguery is still feeling its way in Congress for a
			friendly go-between.”</p>

		<p>As a remedy for this condition of affairs, Mr. Julian recommends
		resurveys of all grants about which there is any doubt, and the
		entering of suits to set aside patents obtained by fraud.</p>

			<p>“Where land capable of cultivation with profit, and not devoted

			<p>“The compensation is to be only the ‘payment to the owner for a

			<p>“The local authorities are to let the lands thus acquired to tenant

			<p>“We have taken a tour of the continent and of Great Britain, and
			although we have seen many places, we have seen no place like
			home—no place in all respects equal to America. You will find in
			the Old World much that is admirable, but what impressed me most
			painfully was the poverty of the masses of the people. Why, the
			people in Europe live on the poorest food, and mighty little of it. I
			found that laborers in Glasgow work for 2s. 6d. a day—sixty-two
			cents. I was charmed with Edinburgh, but when I saw women
			drunk and fighting in her beautiful streets, the modern Athens lost
			her charms. I cannot convey to you the picture of the degradation
			and want throughout Great Britain, caused by drink. I come back
			a stouter cold-water man than when I went away. The drink evil is
			a horror. Speaking of wages, I found girls in factories in Venice
			working with great skill for from five to twelve cents a day, the most
			experienced getting twelve cents a day, out of which they have to
			live, but how they live is a wonder. Their chief diet is macaroni.
			Farm hands all over Europe—women—earn twenty cents a day.
			Women do most of the field work. I saw no improved machinery
			on the farms of the continent. I have seen twenty women in one
			field at work—not a man in sight. The plain people see no meat to
			eat once a week on the continent. The condition of American
			wage-earners is incomparably better than that of working people in
			Europe. It’s the difference between comfort and competence, and
			discomfort and insufficient food and clothing.</p>

		which has excited an inquiry and comment in Parliament, and
		is likely to result in the punishment of the policeman. The New
		York <cite>Sun</cite> says:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>“The case of Miss Cass, who was arrested in Regent Street as a
			disreputable character, has started in the <cite>Pall Mall Gazette</cite> a discussion
			of the annoyances to which decent women are subjected in
			the streets of London. It will be remembered that she was a
			respectable girl recently arrived in London, where she had obtained
			employment in a milliner’s shop, and that while waiting in Regent
			Street early in the evening she was arrested by a policeman, who
			insisted in regarding her as a professional street-walker, as which,
			also, she was held by a magistrate, who refused, to listen to her
			denials and explanations.</p>

			<p>“Many women have accordingly written to the <cite>Pall Mall Gazette</cite>
			to ask why, if a woman is liable to arrest on the mere suspicion of
			having addressed a man, men are allowed to annoy and insult women
			in the London streets with perfect impunity. The testimony of
			them all is that, even in the daytime, a lady with any claims to good
			looks, and who walks alone, is always liable to such treatment, no
			matter how modest her apparel and reserved her demeanor. It is
			not merely of insolent and persistent staring that they complain, for
			they have grown to expect that as a matter of course; but they are
			actually spoken to by men who are strangers to them, in the most
			insinuating and offensively flattering terms. These men are commonly
			described as ‘gentlemen’ in appearance; ‘a tall, distinguished,
			military-looking man;’ ‘a youthful diplomat;’ ‘a government
			official, a man holding a lucrative appointment,’ and the like.
			They are not roughs; from them ladies have nothing of the sort to
			fear; but men who think to have the greater success and to enjoy
			the complete immunity because they wear the garb of gentlemen.</p>

			<p>“Rev. Mr. Haweis writes that ‘you might easily fill the <cite>Pall Mall

		lead, as large as practicable, and the other below it, so as to have the
		attraction of the leaden globe pulling up and counteracting the
		gravitation to the earth. The effect is very slight and requires
		delicate apparatus.</p>

		<p>By another, but more inaccurate method, the attraction of the
		earth has been compared with that of a mountain—a very indefinite
		method indeed. A better method was that of Astronomer Airy and
		Mr. Dunkin, who went down into the Harton coal pit 1,260 feet to

		rectification is completed, the science attains a grand simplicity, and,
		instead of being puzzled by cerebral organology, a very brief instruction
		will enable us to master the subject. In 1836 I instructed

	<p>The first question that occurs to the enlightened enquirer, when
	he learns that the functions of the brain have been positively determined
	by experiment, is whether the cranioscopy of Gall and Spurzheim
	was successful in locating the cerebral functions, and how
	nearly their inferences from development correspond with the
	revelations of experiment.</p>

	<p>It is with great pleasure that I am able to say that the system of
	Gall and Spurzheim was a wonderful approximation to the truth.
	Dr. Gall was pre-eminently the scientific pioneer of the nineteenth
	century. No single individual ever did so much to enlarge the
	sphere of human knowledge, and to establish the permanent foundations
	of philosophy. Up to his time, the brain of man was at once
	the greatest mystery of anatomy and the repository of a greater
	amount of wisdom and truth than all other realms of science which
	had previously been explored. But so limited was the knowledge,
	and so narrow the understanding of the learned, that the grandeur of
	cerebral science was not even suspected, and, even at the present time,
	it is so remote from the speculations of the learned that, like a distant
	star, it has few practical relations to their life; nor will its magnitude be
	realized until an ample literature shall have made its scientific record.</p>

	<p>Into this field of mystery, Dr. Gall advanced with a courage unknown
	to his predecessors, and his success was equal to his courage.
	The entire plan and constitution of the brain were revealed by his
	anatomical genius, and his successors have but carried further and
	perfected his anatomical system. His anatomical exposition of the
	brain, addressed to the French Institute in 1808, is one of the great
	landmarks of the progress of science—the commencement of a new
	era; and his exposition of its functions was the solution of a
	problem which had defied the genius and learning of all his predecessors.
	His discoveries in anatomy were so great that Reil (himself
	a brain anatomist of the highest rank, whose name is permanently
	associated with anatomy by the name “Island of Reil,” which
	belongs to the location in which Gall made his first discovery of the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page24" title="24"> </a>faculty and organ of language), Reil, I say, declared that Dr. Gall
	had shown him more in his dissections of the brain than he
	thought it possible for any one man to have discovered in his lifetime;
	and, in fact, some of the old anatomists, not having been
	personally instructed by Gall, professed to find it difficult, if not
	impossible, to unfold the brain after his manner.</p>

	<p>These discoveries gave Dr. Gall at once a very eminent rank
	among the learned, for anatomy being a physical science, there never has
	been any opposition, jealousy, or scepticism against its cultivation among
	the educated, nor was there anything marvellous in his revelation of
	cerebral functions, for he studied only the common familiar faculties of
	men and animals, and never looked into the mysterious and marvellous
	powers which a more thorough investigation has revealed.</p>

	<p>Indeed, his reception at first was quite triumphant, and it was not
	until the death of Gall and Spurzheim, leaving no able and competent
	representative to carry on their labors, that the drift of medical
	scepticism and ignorance arrested the progress of his doctrines. I
	say <em>ignorance</em>, for the aversion to the doctrines of Gall was due far
	more to the ignorance of the profession and their entire neglect of
	the craniological method than to any other causes.</p>

	<p>Gall had good reason to be satisfied with his first reception, except
	as to the hostility of the Austrian government, which suppressed
	his lectures and compelled him to go abroad, settling finally
	in Paris, where he again encountered governmental hostility in the
	unfriendliness of Bonaparte, whose rejection alike of Gall and of
	Fulton, who wished to introduce steam navigation, demonstrated
	that great military and political ability may co-exist with great shallowness
	of mind in reference to all things new, original, and philanthropic.
	So it has always been, and so it continues.</p>

	<p>In his travels in Germany, from 1805 to 1807, accompanied by Dr.
	Spurzheim, “I experienced everywhere (said Gall) the most flattering
	reception. Sovereigns, ministers, philosophers, legislators, artists
	seconded my design on all occasions, augmenting my collection, and
	furnishing me everywhere with new observations. The circumstances
	were too favorable to permit me to resist the invitations which
	came to me from most of the universities.” Thirty-four of the leading
	cities and seats of learning enjoyed the visits of Gall and Spurzheim
	before they settled in Paris, where, although French jealousy
	arose against this German invasion, and the influence of Napoleon
	prevented their cordial reception, they nevertheless commanded and
	retained the respect of scientists and had many devoted friends, including
	Broussais and Andral, who then stood at the head of the
	medical profession, and of Corvisart, Napoleon’s physician, who
	could not overcome his master’s prejudice.</p>

	<p>In speaking of the great void left by the decease of Gall and
	Spurzheim, I do not forget that for a few years George Combe, Dr.
	Elliotson, and Dr. Macartney, of England, and Dr. Caldwell, of
	America, survived, but these eminent gentlemen were not so identified
	with the science, or so competent to sustain it as to wear the
	mantle of its founders. My own labors beginning after the death of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page25" title="25"> </a>the founders were those of investigation and discovery, and never to
	any great extent those of propagation. Indeed, for twenty years I
	entirely abandoned the scientific rostrum, and almost ended my
	labors, feeling that my duty had been done in the way of development
	and demonstration. But in accordance with the great law of
	periodicity, I resumed my labors in 1877-78.</p>

	<p>When we look at the doctrines of Gall and Spurzheim in the light of
	positive science and philosophy, our first observation is that they fell
	very far short of revealing the entire functions of the brain, and discovering
	in it all the important spiritual and physical faculties and energies of
	life. They did not attempt to explore the brain as a physiological organ,
	and determine how or in what special organs it controls the physiological
	functions. These may be regarded as one half, though the lower half,
	of its capacities, out of which arises a vast amount of medical philosophy.</p>

	<p>As to the psychic half of the cerebral functions, they omitted
	entirely that portion which relates to pneumatology. They thought
	nothing of the soul as an object of science, and made no attempt to
	trace its connection with the brain, and the vast number of phenomena
	which lie along the border line between the physical and
	spiritual, and which are conspicuous in the phenomena of somnambulism,
	sleep, dreaming, hypnotism, spiritualism, clairvoyance, trance,
	ecstasy, and religious marvels.</p>

	<p>Overlooking these things, they sought the seats of from twenty-seven
	faculties (as with Gall) to thirty-five (as with Spurzheim), and
	did not appear to realize how many had been entirely omitted.
	When all they attempted to locate are located by positive experiment
	and assigned their proper localities and limits, we find fully
	one half of the cerebral surface vacant for organs of other functions.
	Indeed, the first large publication of Gall and Spurzheim, in four
	volumes folio, with an atlas of 100 plates, begun in 1809 and finished
	in 1819, did not in the cranial map of organs profess to be a complete
	development of the functions of the brain. It located organs, but
	did not determine the functions intermediate between their boundaries.
	This was the map of Gall. In that of Spurzheim the intermediate
	spaces were occupied and the entire exterior surface of the
	brain devoted to organology, yet still the basilar and interior surface
	of the brain remained unknown to Spurzheim, and the exterior
	regions which he supposed entirely occupied by his organs were but
	half occupied by them. Thus when we consider the unexplored
	basilar and interior regions, and that half of its exterior surface
	which was erroneously appropriated to the thirty-five organs, as well
	as the erroneous location of several, we perceive that <em>more than half</em>
	of the organs and functions of the brain remained for investigation.</p>

	<p>Turning away from the anatomy to contemplate the psychology,
	we perceive that <em>more than half of human nature</em> had been omitted
	from the German scheme,—that half of the mental functions which
	belongs to the organs of the vacant spaces on the corrected map, and
	in addition to these the higher psychic functions, and the lower
	physiological functions, neither of which Gall and Spurzheim
	explored, because they did not attempt to study the brain as a
	<a class="pagenum" id="page26" title="26"> </a>physiological organ, and they did not bring the soul and the higher
	functions of the mind within the scope of their science.</p>

	<p>Gall was a bold, original naturalist and anatomist but not a psychologist;
	and the incorrectness of his psychology hindered his
	investigations, and prevented him from carrying out a proper subdivision
	of faculties and organs. He says in the last volume: “Each
	fundamental power, essentially distinct, includes sensation, perception,
	memory and recollection, judgment and imagination,”—disregarding
	the truth that these are distinct intellectual powers, belonging
	to different organs, and therefore bearing no proportion to each
	other. One may have an immense memory without imagination, or a
	brilliant imagination without much memory. These, and many other
	psychological errors, are apparent in the writings of Gall, and still
	more in those of Spurzheim.</p>

		<a href="images/illo1.png"><img src="images/illo1-th.png" width="362" height="443" alt="Sketch of head in profile, with areas named on it." /></a>
	</div>

	<p>In the drawing herewith presented, the thirty-five organs of Spurzheim
	are assigned their proper locations and dimensions. The first
	<a class="pagenum" id="page27" title="27"> </a>organ, <strong class="emphasis">Amativeness</strong> (made second by Spurzheim), was assumed to
	occupy the entire cerebellum. It really occupies only its median
	and superior portion, and a small section of the anterior surface of
	the spinal cord, adjacent to the encephalon. This error of Gall and
	Spurzheim did a great deal to discredit their system. It manifested
	on their part a fallibility of judgment, and a dogmatic adherence to
	first impressions in the face of evidence to the contrary; for the
	experiments of Rolando and Flourens demonstrated a connection
	between the cerebellum and the general vital force and muscular
	action. The relation may not have been clearly understood, but the
	facts were decisive, and the researches of Majendie, with the more
	recent ones of Ferrier, have made more clear the relations of the
	cerebellum to the muscular system and vital force.</p>

	<p>The doctrine of Gall has been abandoned by physiologists because
	refuted by many facts, the most decisive of which is that the cerebellum
	of castrated horses is larger than that of stallions, which
	could not be possible if the cerebellum had only sexual functions.
	Moreover, the doctrine of Gall was essentially unreasonable in itself.
	To suppose that so large a portion of the brain which is continually
	active, being well supplied with blood, could have a function which
	is but occasionally active, and which, through the greater part of
	human life, is unnoticed or inactive, is extremely unreasonable; and
	to suppose that the serious disturbances of animal life and muscular
	motion, caused by ablations of the cerebellum, were due to the disturbance
	of an organ having only sexual functions, was thoroughly
	absurd. The parrot-like repetition of these exploded errors by the
	followers of the phrenological system contributed to its discredit in
	the medical profession.</p>

	<p>The 2d organ of Gall (3d of Spurzheim), <strong class="emphasis">Philoprogenitiveness</strong>,
	was regarded as one of the best known phrenological
	organs, but my unprejudiced study of heads soon assured me of its
	inaccuracy. The organ was small in Spurzheim, who was remarkably
	fond of children, and I have found it small in ladies who showed
	no lack of parental love, but generally well developed and active in
	criminal skulls. One which I obtained in Arkansas, of a man named
	Richmond, had this region large and active, although he was the one
	of a group of murderers by whom the children, or, rather, boys, were
	killed. This region is <em>extremely defective</em> in the brains of birds,
	which are certainly very devoted to their young. The attachment to
	children belongs really to an interior region of the occiput, where
	the occipital lobes face the median line. Hence it is that a large
	occipital development very often coincides with the love of children;
	but the true position of the organ renders it difficult to determine
	its development in life.</p>

	<p><strong class="emphasis">Adhesiveness</strong> (3d) is located by Spurzheim farther back and lower
	than it should be; also, too far back in Gall’s map. It belongs to
	the vacant space in front of Gall’s location.</p>

	<p><strong class="emphasis">Inhabitiveness</strong> (5th) is an imaginary definition of the function
	located behind Self-esteem. Equally imaginary is the doctrine of
	the Edinburgh phrenologists, who call it Concentrativeness. The
	<a class="pagenum" id="page28" title="28"> </a>observations of Gall led him to regard it as a portion of the organ of
	Pride, and as giving to animals a love of lofty locations. Gall was
	nearer right than Spurzheim or Combe. The only function I find
	in this spot is Self-confidence. The tendencies to a quiet love of
	home, and the ability to tranquillize and concentrate the mind, are
	located, virtually, above the ear on the temporal arch, the ridge
	which separates the lateral from the superior surface of the
	head.</p>

	<p><strong class="emphasis">Destructiveness</strong>, the 5th organ of Gall and 1st of Spurzheim,
	was located much too high and too far forward by Gall. I am surprised
	at this, since it differs so widely from the indications of comparative
	anatomy that it is difficult to imagine how Gall was misled.
	Any one comparing the skull of a dog with that of a sheep may discover
	the error. He called it Murder, or the wish to destroy. Spurzheim,
	who does not describe its location, says, “At the beginning
	Gall placed the seat of this organ too far behind the ear, but a great
	number of observations convinced us that its seat is immediately
	above the ear.” The truth is that the convolutions which terminate
	on the temporal bone over the ear are only on the border of Destructiveness,
	and produce only an irritable and impulsive temper. The
	true Destructiveness extends fully an inch under the surface of the
	middle lobe, along the petrous ridge of the temporal bone, and is
	manifested externally just behind the ear by the prominence of the
	mastoid process.</p>

	<p><strong class="emphasis">Combativeness</strong> (the 6th of Spurzheim, or Courage and Self-defence,
	the 4th of Gall) is located with tolerable correctness by
	each and properly described.</p>

	<p><strong class="emphasis">Secretiveness</strong>, which is but a modification of Cautiousness, occupying
	its middle region, is much too large on the maps, and on
	that of Gall it is quite out of place—too far forward and too high
	up, occupying a region which produces modesty and refinement.</p>

	<p><strong class="emphasis">Acquisitiveness</strong> (7th of Gall, 8th of Spurzheim) is still farther
	mislocated on the map of Gall, occupying a region of intellectual,
	inventive and literary capacity. This is the most <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">outre</em> and absurd of
	all Gall’s locations. Placing this selfish and grasping propensity in
	the front lobe which belongs to intellect, when it really belongs to
	the selfish, adhesive, and combative elements of the occiput, is an
	error of so extravagant a character as to show that Gall had no correct
	psychology in his mind, and no capacity or desire to construct a
	harmonious system. Spurzheim’s location, much farther back, is
	somewhat less erroneous, but both are thoroughly false, and a few
	months of my first observations fifty-two years ago satisfied me as to
	this error. That it should have flourished unchallenged by Phrenologists
	for eighty years, seems to show that when a dominant idea
	is once established in the mind, all facts are made to conform to it.
	Is is remarkable, too, that the very great difference between the locations
	given by Gall and by Spurzheim has not attracted notice. But
	in fact the map of Gall has never had any popular currency. Spurzheim
	and Combe have been the accepted authors. The true location
	of acquisitiveness is anterior to combativeness, and lower than
	<a class="pagenum" id="page29" title="29"> </a>adhesiveness. Gall was misled by studying the young pickpockets
	and thieves of Vienna. The organ that he found suits a low cunning
	and dextrous character when the head lacks elevation.</p>

	<p><strong class="emphasis">Constructiveness</strong>, Spurzheim’s 9th (Bausinn, or aptitude for
	mechanical arts, of Gall No. 19), is decidedly mislocated by Spurzheim.
	Instead of being placed in the purely intellectual region adjacent
	to calculation, order, and system, it is carried back and down
	into the region of somnolence and sensitive impressibility. Gall’s
	location is a little worse because lower, being carried out of the
	intellectual region into the middle lobe according to his published
	map. It is very easy to detect this error in examining a number of
	heads, and it was quite apparent to me in my first year’s observations.
	In impressible persons the touch upon this locality produces nothing
	but a dreamy influence, and a disposition to close the eyes. Carried
	farther, it produces the mesmeric sleep.</p>

	<p><strong class="emphasis">Cautiousness</strong> (the 10th of both Spurzheim and Gall) was too far
	back in Spurzheim’s map, occupying space that belongs to adhesiveness.
	It runs downward along the course of the lateral convolutions,
	and its more timid and gloomy functions are developed near the ear,
	differing widely from the functions of its upper portion.</p>

	<p><strong class="emphasis">Approbativeness</strong> (the 11th of Spurzheim, and 9th of Gall)
	is located with substantial correctness, covering, however, more functions
	than that term expresses. Gall’s location and definition
	are also substantially correct.</p>

	<p><strong class="emphasis">Self-Esteem</strong> (the 12th of Spurzheim, 8th of Gall) is well located
	and described with approximative correctness.</p>

	<p><strong class="emphasis">Firmness, Religion</strong> (Veneration or Theosophy), and <strong class="emphasis">Benevolence</strong>
	are so well located and described by both Gall and Spurzheim
	as to need but little comment at present. The four superior
	organs on the median line, and the organ of <strong class="emphasis">Conscientiousness</strong>
	were more correctly located and described than any other large portion
	of the brain.</p>

	<p><strong class="emphasis">Hope</strong> is not adjacent to Conscientiousness, but parallel to Religion.</p>

	<p><strong class="emphasis">Marvellousness</strong> has a preposterously large space assigned it,
	being really a small organ at the summit of Ideality, which exercises
	a more intellectual and less superstitious function than has been
	given it. Marvellousness, Hope, Conscientiousness, Time, Order,
	Weight, Size, and Individuality are the eight organs discovered and
	added by Spurzheim, not having been recognized by Gall. The
	exterior portion of Spurzheim’s Marvellousness occupies the space
	devoted by Gall to Poetry.</p>

	<p><strong class="emphasis">Poetry</strong>, recognized by Gall, is brought lower by Spurzheim and
	called <strong class="emphasis">Ideality</strong>. Both locations are substantially correct. The location
	of Gall is the seat of Marvellousness, Imagination, and Spirituality;
	that of Spurzheim is well expressed by the term Ideality, and the
	description given, but the word Poetry is rather too limited as the
	definition of Gall’s organ. It gives brilliance to prose and to oratory,
	or even conversation, as well as to poetry.</p>

	<p><strong class="emphasis">Imitation</strong>, adjacent to Benevolence, is somewhat better located by
	Gall than by Spurzheim, who gives it too much breadth anteriorly.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page30" title="30"> </a><strong class="emphasis">Wit</strong> or <strong class="emphasis">Mirthfulness</strong> is a confused and erroneous statement.
	The two faculties are distinct, Wit being intellectual and occupying a
	small space adjacent to Causality or Reason, while Mirthfulness, or
	the sentiment of the ludicrous, is just above it, and should properly
	be called Humor. The mirthful or playful faculty is in the posterior
	region adjacent to Approbativeness, and may be quite conspicuous
	when there is neither wit nor humor in the mirth. Imitation, Mirth
	or Humor, and Wit follow each other in a line. The so-called organ
	of Wit (Gall) or Mirthfulness (Spurzheim) is the seat of the most
	profound reasoning faculty, while the <strong class="emphasis">Causality</strong> of Spurzheim, the
	<strong class="emphasis">Metaphysical Depth</strong> of thought of Gall, though it gives a clear
	analytical intelligence has really less profundity and ability
	in reasoning than the organ which they have misnamed Wit and
	Mirthfulness, which is pre-eminently the organ of profound reasoning.</p>

	<p><strong class="emphasis">Eventuality</strong> and <strong class="emphasis">Individuality</strong> are confounded as one
	organ by Gall, calling it Educability, or Memory of Things
	but rightly separated by Spurzheim, as the observation and
	memory of events are distinct from the observation of things.
	Though I do not use the word Individuality, it is not an objectionable
	expression, as it suggests the fine perceptive power of its location.
	Both Gall and Spurzheim had a practically good idea of the
	region of Eventuality, which Gall first called the memory of things.
	Spurzheim’s description is good; but when the organ is analyzed, it
	yields consciousness and observation on the median line, memory
	more exterior, extending to Time.</p>

	<p><strong class="emphasis">Perceptive Organs</strong>—The most marvellous feature of the old
	phrenological system, is the accuracy with which the smallest organs
	of the brain have been discovered, located, and described. The organs
	of Form, Size, Weight, Color, Order, and Number, or Calculation,
	were so accurately located and described by Spurzheim, that little remains
	to be said about them. Gall discovered only Form, Color, and
	Number, and the latter he located in the position which belongs to Order.
	These organs were but little developed in Gall, whose great success
	was due to his philosophic originality and independence. He was not a
	close observer, and there was a sternness in his nature which prevented
	him from accepting readily the suggestions of Spurzheim,
	who with less boldness of character and greater accuracy of perception,
	was better fitted for minute observation and anatomical
	analysis. His own cranium has been preserved, in which I found
	these perceptive organs distinctly marked by their digital impressions
	on the superorbital plate over the eye. It is a remarkable fact that
	the intellectual faculties have been most easily understood and
	located, while their antagonists in the occipital region have proved
	the greatest puzzle in psychic and cerebral investigations. Gall
	failed, and left a vacant space in the occiput. Spurzheim failed, but
	covered the ground incorrectly, and it was many years after I discovered
	cerebral impressibility before I attained a satisfactory view
	of the psychology of this region. The location and definition of
	<strong class="emphasis">Locality</strong> are substantially correct.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page31" title="31"> </a>The organ of <strong class="emphasis">Time</strong>, another of Spurzheim’s discoveries, was very
	correctly located and defined by him. It lies just above the organ of
	Color.</p>

	<p><strong class="emphasis">Comparative Sagacity</strong>, or Perspicacity, as Gall called it, was a
	better term than Comparison, which was introduced by Spurzheim.
	Direct perception of truth is its leading character. Illustration by
	comparison belongs to the breadth of the forehead, to the Ideal and
	Inventive region, and is the characteristic of poetry. Spurzheim’s
	description, however, is substantially correct. It qualifies for clear
	statement, but not for comprehensive or ingenious reasoning. The
	portion on the median line has still more penetration, in consequence
	of which it perceives the nature and tendencies of everything, and
	is enabled to exercise foresight. Still farther in on the median line
	are located the powers which are more intuitive, and transcending
	ordinary foresight are entitled to be called prophecy.</p>

	<p>The <strong class="emphasis">Causality</strong> of Spurzheim, or Metaphysical Depth of thought
	of Gall, was defined with approximate correctness. The immediate
	perception of causation lies just above the organ of Time, and
	the special organ of Reason extends therefrom upwards. If the
	reflective organs of one side of the forehead are divided into an
	interior and exterior group by a vertical line from the pupil of the
	eye, the interior group would represent a comprehensive understanding
	possessing sagacity and judgment, while the exterior would
	represent profound ingenious thought and originality, a capacity for
	discovering truth by reason and meditation, by analysis and synthesis,
	while the interior would discover it only by direct perception.
	In the exterior group would be included the misnamed organ
	of Wit or Mirthfulness, which is really a source of philosophy and
	originality.</p>

	<p><strong class="emphasis">Tune</strong> and <strong class="emphasis">Constructiveness</strong> have really reversed their positions
	in the maps of Spurzheim and Gall. The inventive faculty of
	musical composers was what Gall discovered as Music. The sense
	of Melody and Tune lies behind the brow in connection with the
	<em>sense of hearing</em>, at the anterior portion of Sensibility, which forty
	years after my discovery is beginning to be recognized in consequence
	of the experiments of Ferrier on animals. The organ of
	hearing which he demonstrated in the monkey, occupies the same
	position in the superior temporal convolution, behind the eye, which
	I have given it in man, which brings it into close connection with
	the organs of Language and Tune. Its close connection with the
	region of impressibility called Somnolence explains its supreme
	control over our emotions.</p>

	<p>The organ of <strong class="emphasis">Language</strong>, the first discovery of Gall, has been the
	first to receive its demonstration from pathology and vivisection.
	But the pioneer teacher to whom contemporaries are unjust has to
	wait very long for an honorable recognition. The existence of an
	organ of Language at the junction of the front and middle lobes, at
	the back of the eye-sockets, has become established in our physiology
	from the developments of disease and autopsies, without
	mentioning in connection that it was the discovery of Gall. Perhaps
	<a class="pagenum" id="page32" title="32"> </a>the authors of the text-books may not even know the location of
	Gall’s discovery in the brain, and think only of the external sign,
	the prominence of the eyes, produced by the convolution at the back
	of their orbits.</p>

	<p>Dr. Spurzheim simply located the external sign of the prominence
	of the organ at the eye, while Gall recognized the talent for
	languages as lying further back than that for verbal memory, and
	consequently being manifested lower at the eye. Nevertheless Gall
	made a correct observation, as he noticed that a full development
	was indicated when the temples were broad behind the eye.
	The true location of the organ externally is just behind the outer
	angle of the eye, a position central to Gall’s observations, and corresponding
	in the brain to that junction of the front and middle lobes
	in which the organ has been demonstrated by pathology, though not
	so accurately defined as in my experiments.</p>

	<p>Perhaps in twenty or thirty years more my demonstrations having
	been brought before the public may attract the attention of the laborious
	vivisectors in Europe, who have done so much to verify them, and

		<h3>COLLEGE OF THERAPEUTICS.</h3>

		<p class="ad_pstyle_3">Next Session Begins November 1, 1887.</p>

		<p>This institution is the germ of what will be an
		immense revolution in education hereafter, when
		the knowledge now given to small classes will hold
		a conspicuous place in every college, and will be
		presented in every high school.</p>

		<p>The mountain mass of inertia, which opposes, passively,
		all fundamental changes, cannot now resist
		scientific demonstration as it has in the past.
		The instruction in the College of Therapeutics, is
		thoroughly demonstrative, leaving no room for
		doubt, and it gives a species of knowledge which
		ought to be a part of every one’s education—a
		knowledge of the constitution of man, not obtainable
		to-day in any medical or literary college, nor
		in our mammoth libraries. It is not merely as a
		deep philosophy that this interests us, but as a
		guide in the preservation of health, and in the
		regulation of spiritual phenomena, which would, to
		a very great extent, supersede our reliance on the
		medical profession by giving us the control of the
		vital powers, by which we may protect ourselves,
		and control the development of the young.</p>

		<p>Each student was made to feel the effects of local
		treatment on the body, and the power of rapidly
		changing disease to health, and was personally
		taught to perform the manipulations for this purpose,
		and to investigate disease or portray character
		by the psychometric methods as well as to test
		the value of medicines.</p>

		<p>The various uses and scientific application of
		electricity were shown, and many things entirely
		unknown and unrecognized in works on Electro-Therapeutics.
		The entire class was placed under
		a medical influence simultaneously by the agency
		of electricity—an operation so marvelous that it
		would be considered incredible in medical colleges.
		By these and other experiments and numerous
		illustrations and lucid explanations of the brain
		and nervous system, the instruction was made
		deeply interesting, and students have attended
		more than one course to perfect themselves in
		the science. The following declaration of sentiments
		shows how the course was regarded by the
		class:</p>

		<p>“The summer class of 1887 in the College of
		Therapeutics, feeling it their duty to add their
		testimony to that of many others in reference to
		the grand scientific discoveries which they have
		seen thoroughly demonstrated by Prof. J. R.
		Buchanan, would say to the public that no one can
		attend such a course of instruction as we have recently
		been engaged in, without realizing that
		Therapeutic Sarcognomy greatly enlarges the practical
		resources of the healing art for the medical
		practitioner, magnetizer and electro-therapeutist,
		while Psychometry, whose positive truths we have
		tested and proven, like the sun’s rays, illumines
		all the dark problems of medical practice and of
		psycho-physiological sciences.</p>

		<p>“Therapeutic Sarcognomy explains the very intricate
		and mysterious relations of the soul, the brain
		and body, which prior to Prof. Buchanan’s discoveries
		were unknown to all scientific teachers,
		and are even now only known to his students and
		the readers of his works,</p>

		<p>“We feel that we have been very fortunate in finding
		so valuable a source of knowledge, whose future
		benefits to the human race, in many ways, cannot
		be briefly stated, and we would assure all who may
		attend this college, or read the published works of
		Prof. Buchanan, and his monthly, the <cite>Journal of
		Man</cite>, that they will, when acquainted with the subject,
		be ready to unite with us in appreciating and
		honoring the greatest addition ever made to biological
		and psychological sciences. Hoping that the time
		is not for distant when all students in medical colleges
		may obtain access to this most important
		knowledge, we give our testimony to the public.”</p>

		<h3>OBITUARY RECORD.</h3>

		<p class="ad_pstyle_3">Visit to our Cemetery.</p>

		<p>Sad are the words, “<em>It might have been</em>,” sad
		the recollection of lives untimely ended, and
		equally sad the lives that perished unborn. We
		have been looking among the latter, the spirit life
		that might have gone forth to bless society, but
		perished ere its birth.</p>

		<p>The <cite class="name">Journal of Man</cite> has brought forth many
		a bright, strong thought that will have its career
		among men, but the other bright, strong thoughts
		that could not be forced through its narrow limits
		must be buried and lost to its readers, and they
		have been interred with sorrow. The following
		is a list of our early dead—perhaps for some of
		them there may be a resurrection when a larger
		<cite class="name">Journal</cite> is issued, but perhaps the majority are
		interred forever.</p>

		needless to prolong the catalogue of the buried
		innocents,—the interesting narratives, discussions
		and expositions of rare knowledge which the
		limited area of the <cite class="name">Journal</cite> has compelled me to
		exclude.</p>

		<p>Let us hope that in our enlarged <cite class="name">Journal</cite> next
		year, there may be room to review the most important
		features of social and scientific progress as
		well as to present gradually the elements of that

		presentation of which will require at
		least ten years. I am making every effort at
		present to prepare the improved and enlarged
		edition of the Therapeutic Sarcognomy for the
		coming winter.</p>

		<h3>MAYO’S ANÆSTHETIC.</h3>

		<p>The suspension of pain, under dangerous surgical
		operations, is the greatest triumph of Therapeutic
		Science in the present century. It came
		first by mesmeric hypnotism, which was applicable
		only to a few, and was restricted by the jealous
		hostility of the old medical profession. Then
		came the nitrous oxide, introduced by Dr. Wells,
		of Hartford, and promptly discountenanced by the
		enlightened (?) medical profession of Boston, and
		set aside for the next candidate, ether, discovered
		in the United States also, but far interior to the
		nitrous oxide as a safe and pleasant agent. This was
		largely superseded by chloroform, discovered much
		earlier by Liebig and others, but introduced as an
		anæsthetic in 1847, by Prof. Simpson. This proved
		to be the most powerful and dangerous of all.
		Thus the whole policy of the medical profession
		was to discourage the safe, and encourage the more
		dangerous agents. The magnetic sleep, the most
		perfect of all anæsthetic agents, was expelled from
		the realm of college authority; ether was substituted
		for nitrous oxide, and chloroform preferred to
		ether, until frequent deaths gave warning.</p>

		<p>Nitrous oxide, much the safest of the three, has
		not been the favorite, but has held its ground,
		especially with dentists. But even nitrous oxide is
		not perfect. It is not equal to the magnetic sleep,
		when the latter is practicable, but fortunately it is
		applicable to all. To perfect the nitrous oxide,
		making it universally safe and pleasant, Dr. U. K.
		Mayo, of Boston, has combined it with certain
		harmless vegetable nervines, which appear to control
		the fatal tendency which belongs to all anæsthetics
		when carried too far. The success of Dr.
		Mayo, in perfecting our best anæsthetic, is amply
		attested by those who have used it. Dr. Thorndike,
		than whom, Boston had no better surgeon, pronounced
		it “the safest the world has yet seen.”
		It has been administered to children and to patients
		in extreme debility. Drs. Frizzell and Williams,
		say they have given it “repeatedly in heart disease,
		severe lung diseases, Bright’s disease, etc., where
		the patients were so feeble as to require assistance
		in walking, many of them under medical treatment,
		and the results have been all that we could
		ask—no irritation, suffocation, nor depression.
		We heartily commend it to all as the anæsthetic of
		the age.” Dr. Morrill, of Boston, administered
		Mayo’s anæsthetic to his wife with delightful
		results when “her lungs were so badly disorganized,
		that the administration of ether or gas
		would be entirely unsafe.” The reputation of this
		anæsthetic is now well established; in fact, it is
		not only safe and harmless, but has great medical
		virtue for daily use in many diseases, and is coming
		into use for such purposes. In a paper before
		the Georgia State Dental Society, Dr. E. Parsons
		testified strongly to its superiority. “The nitrous
		oxide, (says Dr. P.) causes the patient when fully
		under its influence to have very like the appearance
		of a corpse,” but under this new anæsthetic
		“the patient appears like one in a natural sleep.”
		The language of the press, generally has been highly
		commendatory, and if Dr. Mayo had occupied so
		conspicuous a rank as Prof. Simpson, of Edinburgh,
		his new anæsthetic would have been adopted at
		once in every college of America and Europe.</p>

		<p class="ad_pstyle_1">Mayo’s Vegetable Anæsthetic.</p>

		<p>A perfectly safe and pleasant substitute for chloroform,
		ether, nitrous oxide gas, and all other
		anæsthetics. Discovered by Dr. U. K. Mayo, April,
		1883, and since administered by him and others in
		over 300,000 cases successfully. The youngest child,
		the most sensitive lady, and those having heart
		disease, and lung complaint, inhale this vapor with
		impunity. It stimulates the circulation of the
		blood and builds up the tissues. Indorsed by the
		highest authority in the professions, recommended
		in midwifery and all cases of nervous prostration.
		Physicians, surgeons, dentists and private families
		supplied with this vapor, liquefied, in cylinders of
		various capacities. It should be administered the
		same as Nitrous Oxide, but it does not produce
		headache and nausea as that sometimes does. For
